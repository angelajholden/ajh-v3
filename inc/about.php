    <h2>About Me</h2>

  	<p><span class="first-hi">Hi</span>My name is Angela Holden and I’m from Minnesota, but I divide my time between Minneapolis and San Diego. In 2013 I earned a Master’s Degree in Technical Communication. I also have a B.A. in Management & Employment Law, and an A.S. in Paralegal Studies. I worked for the law firm <a href="http://lawmoss.com">Moss & Barnett</a> in Minneapolis for many years as a paralegal and commercial debt collector before I started learning to code.</p>

		<p>This website is a blog and <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/projects/">portfolio of the projects</a> I’ve worked on. I love web design and WordPress, and I’m living the dream as a fulltime front end developer. I work on a variety of projects in numerous industries, and I thoroughly enjoy the collaborative energy I experience with my clients. Being self-employed and doing something I really love is a complete joy that will resonate when you work with me.</p>

    <p>I work from home and I have clients in the U.S. and overseas. For more information about what I can do, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me for a complementary consultation.</p>

    <p>Cheers!</p>
