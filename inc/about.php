    <h2>About Me</h2>

  	<p><span class="first-hi">Hi</span>My name is Angela Holden and I’m from Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2013 I earned a Master’s Degree in Technical Communication with an emphasis on information architecture and usability. I also have a B.A. in Management & Employment Law, and an A.S. in Paralegal Studies. I worked for the law firm <a href="http://lawmoss.com" target="_blank">Moss & Barnett</a> in Minneapolis for many years as a paralegal and commercial debt collector before I started learning to code.</p>

		<p>This website has a <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/projects/">portfolio of the projects</a> I’ve worked on, and I'm proud of what's here. I love web design and WordPress, and I’m living the dream as a full-time front end developer. I work on a variety of projects in numerous industries, and I thoroughly enjoy the collaborative experience I have with my clients. Being self-employed and doing something I really love is a complete joy that will resonate when you work with me.</p>

		<p>In my spare time I do things most people enjoy like reading, watching movies, spending time with my family and friends, and socializing in general. I also play the piano and listen to a lot of classical music. In fact it's the only thing I love more than building websites. Sadly I will probably never be good enough to play most of the music I listen to, but it doesn't seem to stop me from buying sheet music for the pieces I love most, kind of like <a class="fancybox-youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEPpRAsNOU0/?autoplay=1&fs=1&rel=0&enablejsapi=1&playerapiid=ytplayer">this</a>.</p>

    <p>For more information about what I can do, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me for a consultation. You can also review my <a href="<?php bloginfo('url') ?>/terms-conditions/">project terms</a>.</p>

    <p>Cheers!</p>
