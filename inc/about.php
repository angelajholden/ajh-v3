    <h2>About Me</h2>

  	<p><span class="first-hi">Hi</span>My name is Angela Holden and I’m from Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2013 I earned a Master’s Degree in Technical Communication with an emphasis on information architecture and usability. I also have a B.A. in Management &amp; Employment Law, and an A.S. in Paralegal Studies. I worked for <a href="http://www.lawmoss.com/john-rossman/" target="_blank" rel="follow">John K. Rossman</a> at the law firm Moss &amp; Barnett in Minneapolis for over five years as a paralegal, commercial debt collector and executive producer of <a href="http://johnrossmanattorney.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow">The Debt Collection Drill</a> podcast.</p>

		<p>This website has a <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/projects/">portfolio of the projects</a> I’ve worked on. I love HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I’m living the dream as a frontend developer. I work on a variety of projects in numerous industries, and I thoroughly enjoy the collaborative experience I have with my clients.</p>

    <p>For more information about what I can do, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me for a consultation.</p>

    <p>Cheers!</p>
