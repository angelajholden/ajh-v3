  	<p><span class="first-hi">Hi</span>My name is Angela Holden and I’m from Minnesota, but I divide my time between Minneapolis and San Diego. In 2013 I earned a Master’s Degree in Technical Communication. I also have a B.A. in Management & Employment Law, and an A.S. in Paralegal Studies. I worked for the law firm <a href="http://lawmoss.com">Moss & Barnett</a> in Minneapolis for many years as a paralegal and commercial debt collector before I started learning to code.</p>
		<p>I also have an Etsy shop called <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThemeHoney">Theme Honey</a> where I sell a premium theme I designed and developed called <a href="http://themehoney.com/crafty">Crafty</a>. I do a little bit of logo design here as well, and I sell Photoshop files available as a digital download.</p>
		<p>This site was created as a way to show my <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/projects">portfolio</a> and blog about WordPress and web design. I learn new things every day, and I want to share what I learn and give back to a community of designers and developers who openly share their work for people like me to learn from. I hope the work I’m doing helps someone learn to do something they love.</p>
    <p>I work from home and I have clients in the U.S. and overseas. For more information about what I can do, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me for a complementary consultation.</p>
    <p>Cheers!</p>
