    <h2>WordPress Coaching</h2>
    <p>I love teaching my clients about WordPress. Sometimes people want to hire a developer, and sometimes they want to maintain their sites on their own. With WordPress, site owners are more than capable of learning to use this software to manage, change and publish new content.</p>
    <p>In my podcast, <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/category/wordpresscoaching/">WordPress Coaching</a>, I give users practical advice on one topic at a time, in 15 minutes or less. Published every Monday and Thursday, I talk about blogging, content, SEO and Plugins. Listen to the latest episode!</p>
