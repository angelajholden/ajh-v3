    <h2>WordPress Coaching</h2>
    <p>I love teaching my clients about WordPress. Sometimes people just want to hire a developer, and sometimes they want to learn how to manage their sites. There are plenty of situations where the average user is more than capable of learning to use this software to make changes and publish new content.</p>
    <p>In my podcast, <a href="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/category/wordpresscoaching/">WordPress Coaching</a>, I give users practical advice in 15 minutes or less; twice a week. Published every Monday and Thursday, I talk about blogging, content, SEO and Plugins. Listen to the first episode!</p>
