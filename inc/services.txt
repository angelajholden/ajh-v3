I am a WordPress front end developer. My expertise is designing and developing websites from Photoshop to finish using HTML5, CSS, JQuery, and WordPress/PHP. All of my websites are mobile ready and responsive.

<h2><span class="fa fa-usd"></span>Custom Pricing</h2>
My hourly rate for custom work is $40. For small projects, or anything less than 5 hours, I require $100 up front and invoice the remaining amount due after work is completed.
For projects that take more than 5 hours, I estimate the amount of time needed to do the requested work and quote a fixed price. I require 50% to begin work, and the remaining amount due upon completion.

<h2><span class="fa fa-clock-o"></span>Turn Around Time</h2>
For most projects my turn around time is 7-10 days, but hopefully much sooner. For a custom WordPress website the process generally takes 3-4 weeks.

<hr>

<h2><span class="fa fa-picture-o"></span>Images</h2>
For all projects I provide 3-5 complimentary, royalty-free, high resolution images for use on your website.

<h2><span class="fa fa-users"></span>Social Media</h2>
I can suggest ways for you to implement a social media strategy that integrates with your website. For long term social media coaching and branding, I recommend you contact a firm like Social Networkit.

You may consider a subscription to the website Lynda.com and a course called Social Media Marketing with Facebook &amp; Twitter for more information about how to market your business with social media.

<h2><span class="fa fa-tint"></span>Logos &amp; Illustrations</h2>
I do not provide complex graphic design and illustration services. If you need a logo or specialized graphics, I recommend you hire one of the excellent designers on Dribbble.

<hr>

<h2><span class="fa fa-database"></span>Domains, Hosting &amp; Email</h2>
I do not provide domain names, hosting services or email accounts. I recommend GoDaddy for most websites and Media Temple for premium hosting of larger, high traffic websites. All three provide domains, hosting, and email, and I’m happy to help you navigate this process.
